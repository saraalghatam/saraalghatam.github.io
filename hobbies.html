        <h2>  <h2>My favorite sports is Padel</h2></h2>
		
		<p>Padel is my favorite sport because it is simple for new players, the style is not overly complex, therefore somebody who is non-skilled can still enjoy it and play against someone who is more skilled.</p>
      
		<p>People of various talents and ages may go on the field and know the rules because it is an easy game. Although if they are unfamiliar with all the regulations, anyone can come on the floor and also have a good time. </p>
	
		<p>Padel is nowadays successful for its social perspective, by participating a player gets to encounter new players and build friendships while engaging in a fun activity.</p>
