        <h2>  <h2> Skills I learned</h2></h2>
		
		<p>I majored in computer science because it is competitive as well as being continuously an expanding field
		and it became an essential element of our modern environment. An education throughout this
		profession can let a student have a complete knowledge of the principles plus new technology. With
		these skills and understanding, a student be able to create alternatives for modern problems.</p>
        <h2> Skills I learned</h2>
		<p>Studying in the British University of Bahrain has taught me how to manage individual assessment work,
		all of which will be overseen by doctors who assist me in developing relevant investigative and study
		abilities. My courses taught me how to analyze problems in a systematic way and how to construct
		solutions while reviewing the outcomes. Collaboration, cooperation, goal setting is among the abilities
		I learned.</p>
		<h2>Switzerland is my favorite country</h2>
		<p>What I love most Switzerland is the stunning environment which is made up of beautiful lakes, delightful villages, and majestic mountains. Those views are the best part of Switzerland such a great place to visit for tourism. I also like going on road trips with my family like visiting new cities every day. Going on the slides located all over the mountains and enjoy the beautiful views while sliding.</p>
